The new record contains six more characters than the original record.
Therefore, the characters beyond the second 'o' in 'Worthington' would
overwrite the beginning of the next sequential record in the file.
The problem is that, in the formatted input/output model using the stream
insertion operator << and the stream extraction operator >>, fields—and hence
records—can vary in size. For example, values 7, 14, –117, 2074, and 27383 are all ints,
which store the same number of “raw data” bytes internally (typically four bytes on32-bit
machines and eight bytes on 64-bit machines).However, these integers become different sized fields,
depending on their actual values, when output as formatted text (character sequences).
Therefore, the formatted input/output model usually is not used to update records in place.
